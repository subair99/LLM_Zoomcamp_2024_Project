"To evaluate the likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE), the following blood tests are used:

1. **D-dimer test**: This test measures a substance in the blood released when a blood clot breaks down. High levels of D-dimer may indicate the presence of a clot, but a normal D-dimer test suggests that PE is unlikely, especially if the patient has few risk factors.

2. **Other blood tests**: These may check for inherited disorders that lead to blood clots and measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. A clot in the blood vessels of the lungs may reduce oxygen levels.

These tests can assist healthcare providers in assessing the probability of PE in patients presenting with relevant symptoms.",124,What types of blood tests are used to evaluate the likelihood of pulmonary embolism?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by listing the D-dimer test as a primary blood test used to evaluate the likelihood of pulmonary embolism, and it also mentions other relevant blood tests that provide additional information concerning clotting disorders and blood gas levels.

"To determine if your palpitations are related to a heart problem, your doctor will take the following initial steps:

1. **Medical History**: Your doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms, including when the palpitations began, their duration and frequency, whether they are sudden, the nature of your heartbeat during the episodes, accompanying symptoms, and any patterns observed with activities like exercise or caffeine use.

2. **Physical Exam**: Your doctor will conduct a physical examination, which includes taking your pulse to assess heart rate and rhythm, and using a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat. They may also check for signs of conditions that could cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid.

3. **Diagnostic Tests**: The initial test often performed is an EKG (electrocardiogram), which records the heart's electrical activity to evaluate heart rate and rhythm. Depending on the findings, additional tests such as blood tests may be recommended to further assess heart structure, function, and electrical activity. Additionally, if more information is needed regarding intermittent symptoms, your doctor may suggest a Holter or event monitor to capture heart activity over time.
